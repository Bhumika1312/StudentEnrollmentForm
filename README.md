# Student Enrollment Form

## Description
This project implements a **Student Enrollment Form** that allows users to enter and manage student data in the `STUDENT-TABLE` of the `SCHOOL-DB` database. The form includes essential fields such as Roll No, Full Name, Class, Birth Date, Address, and Enrollment Date. The primary key for the table is **Roll No**, ensuring each student's record is unique. The form facilitates data entry with three control buttons: **[Save]**, **[Update]**, and **[Reset]**, enabling efficient management of student information.
